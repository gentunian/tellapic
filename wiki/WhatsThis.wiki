#summary What is tellapic?

This tool is intended to view, pseudo-edit, discuss images and everything related to watching an image without being in the same physical place.

Tellapic is mainly a protocol and a C library that implements it. It defines basic data streams, with custom _read()/write()/connect()_ procedures that wraps default system calls. This project provides a server, implemented in C, and a Java GUI client implementation, that shows how tellapic library can be used widely. The diagram below explains why you can have language independence when writting tellapic clients:

That is, server uses native tellapic library for packet construction, reception, and delivery. Clients, use tellapic bindings from the language they are implemented, or native library if they are written in C.
