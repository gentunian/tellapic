# Tellapic #

This set of tools is intended to view, pseudo-edit, discuss images and everything related to watching an image without being in the same physical place.

Motivation was the lack of this kind of tool (near 2009), for publicity, medical, technic, agronomic, or just fun with a GPL license.

The objetive is to avoid using remote desktop tools for only showing and discussing a computed tomography, a satelital photo, a farm area, football strategy, or any others means you may find to it.

## Java client interacting with python client ##

The video below shows how the applications should interact each other trying to demonstrate their features. There isn't too much features to shown, as this project does not intent to be a photo/picture editor:

## Command-line interface part one ##

Java client has a command-line interface. I call this command-line interface: "programming command-line" because you build shapes using a programming-style commands. I have the idea hanging around of writting another command-line interface named: "CAD command-line" emulating CAD software command-line.

## News ##

The project is almost dead. In my spare time I put my hands in coding or writting some docs. In fact, this project has never seen life beyond friendly testing and personal use in alpha-or-less releases.
